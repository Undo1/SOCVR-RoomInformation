Periodically SOCVR will have room-wide meetings where we discuss room policies and behavior. This page outlines what we talked about.

## April 2016

<!-- [Bookmark to event](link) -->

### Agenda

<!-- add this to each bullet point -->
<!-- [Bookmark](link to topic start) -->

* Can we ask for someone in the room to edit in a relevant tag on a question so that it can be single-handedly closed with the hammer?
* Should we leave a comment under posts that were closed as a result of a cv-pls in order to let the OP know how to improve their question? If so on which close reasons?
* Does the room/group need to be renamed to reflect the fact that it doesn't focus only on "Close" activity?
* Are the activities of the room effective at meeting its goals?
* What can / should we do to make our votes more effective?
* Are we okay with having a lot of members being privileged Smokey users? Should only RO be privileged in SOCVR and let members be privileged in Charcoal HQ if they really want to?
* Should we have an SOCVR Code of Conduct that all regulars are expected to follow, not only in SOCVR but also on SO / MSO / chat / any and all SE places?
* Creating editing events as well as close events (specially while burnating tags); if so, coordination of edits needs to be discussed.
* On smoke detector message where a post only needs to be edited, find a rule to avoid conflicting edits attempts. Example: we post a chat message "I will edit" or similar.
* Should we move the [burnination process](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/SOCVR-RoomInformation/blob/master/burnination.md) to a meta question?
* Should burnination be officially [undertaken by SOCVR](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/SOCVR-RoomInformation/blob/master/burnination.md#process) or should a new "Burninators" specialized room handle it?

### Resolutions

#### Can we ask for someone in the room to edit in a relevant tag on a question so that it can be single-handedly closed with the hammer?

[we will not allow tag-editing for handing off to gold badge holders.](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2016-april-topic-1)

#### Should we leave a comment under posts that were closed as a result of a cv-pls in order to let the OP know how to improve their question? If so on which close reasons?

[No, we should not leave comments under posts that were cv-plsed. It is left up to the user making the request."](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108179/conversation/2016-april-topic-2)

#### Does the room/group need to be renamed to reflect the fact that it doesn't focus only on "Close" activity?

<!-- resolution -->

#### Are the activities of the room effective at meeting its goals?

[So yes I'd say we see on a daily basis that we are effective at meeting our goals]()

#### What can / should we do to make our votes more effective?

[We need a diverse toolset, based on each others need, we need to evaluate what we have now, improve them in the next few months and re-visit this topic the next meeting.]

#### Are we okay with having a lot of members being privileged Smokey users? Should only RO be privileged in SOCVR and let members be privileged in Charcoal HQ if they really want to?

[we are fine with members of SOCVR having permissions to run the bot. RO's will monitor for bot misuse and anyone can bring up odd behavior to the Charcoal room.]()

#### Should we have an SOCVR Code of Conduct that all regulars are expected to follow, not only in SOCVR but also on SO / MSO / chat / any and all SE places?

[If SO rules aren't good enough, let's fix the SO rules.]()

#### Creating editing events as well as close events (specially while burnating tags); if so, coordination of edits needs to be discussed.

[Is there any disagreement to having trial edit events?]() _spoiler: No_

#### On smoke detector message where a post only needs to be edited, find a rule to avoid conflicting edits attempts. Example: we post a chat message "I will edit" or similar.

#### Should we move the [burnination process](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/SOCVR-RoomInformation/blob/master/burnination.md) to a meta question?

#### Should burnination be officially [undertaken by SOCVR](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/SOCVR-RoomInformation/blob/master/burnination.md#process) or should a new "Burninators" specialized room handle it?
