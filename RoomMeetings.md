Periodically SOCVR will have room-wide meetings where we discuss room policies and behavior. This page outlines what we talked about.

## April 2016

### Agenda

* Can we ask for someone in the room to edit in a relevant tag on a question so that it can be single-handedly closed with the hammer?
* Should we leave a comment under posts that were closed as a result of a cv-pls in order to let the OP know how to improve their question? If so on which close reasons?
* Does the room/group need to be renamed to reflect the fact that it doesn't focus only on "Close" activity?
* Are the activities of the room effective at meeting its goals? What can / should we do to make our votes more effective?
* Are we okay with having a lot of members being privileged Smokey users? Should only RO be privileged in SOCVR and let members be privileged in Charcoal HQ if they really want to?
* Should we have an SOCVR Code of Conduct that all regulars are expected to follow, not only in SOCVR but also on SO / MSO / chat / any and all SE places?
* Creating editing events as well as close events (specially while burnating tags); if so, coordination of edits needs to be discussed.
* On smoke detector message where a post only needs to be edited, find a rule to avoid conflicting edits attempts. Example: we post a chat message "I will edit" or similar.
* Should we move the [burnination process](https://github.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/SOCVR-RoomInformation/blob/master/burnination.md) to a meta question?
